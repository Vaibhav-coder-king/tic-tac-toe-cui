# 🕹️ Tic Tac Toe Game in Python (Single & Two Player)

This is a classic Tic Tac Toe game written in Python that you can play in your terminal! It supports both 1-player mode (vs computer bot) and 2-player mode (with a friend), with a neat ASCII art display using the pyfiglet module.

# 🧠 How the Bot Works (Single Player)

The bot makes random moves, offering a basic level of challenge. It doesn't use any AI or strategy algorithms like Minimax — ideal for fun and casual play.

# 🔄 Game Rules
The board has 9 positions labeled 1 to 9.

Players take turns marking X or O on the grid.

First to align three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

If all spots are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
